# SF1MR-VITA
A PS Vita Port of the Popular Mugen Remake of Street Fighter One (SF1MR) using Dolmexica Infinite as the engine. 

Street Fighter One M.U.G.E.N Remake.
Another Mugen Street Fighter game. This time, it is a remake of original very first Street Fighter game, simply called Street Fighter 1, that is also known in home ports as Fighting Street.

After the Release of Dolmexica Infinite ver 1.6, It seemed like the Vita Build of the Mugen interpreter is alot more stable for publishing and making actual custom Fighting games on it.
So to Start the Year 2025 for the Vita Homebrew Commmunity, And to celebrate the Miraculous Dolmexica Infinite that is still being worked on by the amazing Captain Dreamcast.

I would like to release popular Mugen Remake of the first ever Street Fighter Game on the PS Vita.

Fair warning, while this is a port, because of the Interpretors on-going development, there are some differences with the Vita & the PC version of the Mugen game, but they are a few minor differences that will be mentioned in the release page.
But all in all, its a polished port of the original Mugen Game to the Vita.

I hope this would Inspire more potential Developers to start creating Homebrew for the PS Vita, after all "Vita means Life"
